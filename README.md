# hello-world
someone waiting for job

I just woke up at 5AM for an interview at 6:30 and it just only cost 5mins!!!!
Just because someone who interview me is far away from 12hrs difference and don't know how to do without asking for creations.
That's why I came here.
Hope everyone can get a job successfully
